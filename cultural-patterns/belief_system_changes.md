# BELIEF SYSTEM CHANGES

Your only option is to institute changes in the belief system itself that will live on after you.

Those changes will have to fulfill three criteria. They must have an IMMEDIATE SOCIAL VALUE that will cause them to be accepted and maintained even by the unenlightened. They must include a SUBVERSIVE ELEMENT that will chip away at rigid assumptions and speak directly to those who are prepared to break free of their cultural conditioning. And they must contain CODED INFORMATION that will provide those few with clues on how to further the great project of humanization.
