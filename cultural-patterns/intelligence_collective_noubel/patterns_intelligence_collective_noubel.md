# PATTERNS NOUBEL

JF Noubel a identifié de nombreux patterns favorisant l'intelligence collective.

Selon JF Noubel,voici trois processus de cohésion sociale qui tissent le narratif de nos collectifs.

## AUTO-LÉGITIMATION par POLARISATION
## OBJETS MONSTRES (et miam miam), (OBJETS LIENS)
## IGNORANCE ACTIVE 

## ARCHITECTURES VISIBLES
 
Let's imagine a group of people. It can be 20 or a few hundreds, it doesn't really matter. The way people are
going to be placed into space is going to have a crucial influence in the way they will relate to one another,
how they build a collective sense of reality, how the build a sense of the collective itself, how they make their
decision. Are people seating in a circle or is the group broken down in separate tables? Are they around a
square table? A round one? Are they in a train? On the beach? In a restaurant? In a classroom or an
amphitheater all looking at the same person? Who can see who? Who sees the back of who? How does the
room look like? What are the colors? What messages does the furniture carry? Is it an old England castle with
colonial design or a functional corpotate open space? Is there natural sun light or neons? 
 
In these examples we see that all these settings are crucial for determining how the collective is going to
operate. Put this group in a prison in separated cells, or put everyone in an open circle, and we don't have the
same decision making process, although we stay with the same persons.
 
Just like visible architecture, invisible architectures provoke specific social outcomes and patterns. They
influence the way people relate to themselves and to one another, they trigger specific behaviors that lead to
specific forms of consciousness and ways to relate to reality. 

## ARCHITECTURES INVISIBLES

Developing mastery in invisible architectures is a 2 steps process:
1.  Learn how to detect them through details in our everyday life (the way we use certain words or
grammatical structures, the way we behave through social codes, the way we exchange with others
through a specific currency system, etc)
2.  Design new invisible architectures that can trigger higher intelligence, wisdom and consciousness
The design of invisible architectures is an empirical work that has the same dynamics as physical
architectures

## E-PRIME

## SIGNAUX FAIBLES

## OBJETS LIENS

## PIEGES_ONTOLOGIQUES

## POLARISATION SYMBIOTIQUE

## INTELLIGENCE COLLECTIVE PYRAMIDALE
4 patterns: 
### QUELQUES PERSONNES A LA TETE
### CHAINE DE COMMANDEMENT
### DIVISION DU TRAVAIL
### MONNAIE RARE

## BEING AND DOING

### DOXA

set of BELIEFS


### LANGUAGE THINGIFICATION

"Meat" becomes a thing, doesn't provide with understanding of the 
creates a disconnection between ourselves and reality/the world.

### LANGUAGE OVERSIMPLIFICATION

reduce someone to unique quality: "the homeless, the french, the japanese"

## SOCIAL CODES

The way we behave with one another, the way we engage conversations, say hi or bye bye, ask for
something or express our disagreement is strongly driven by cultural patterns. Changing some social codes
can shift consciousness to a new place.
 
For instance it is currently accepted, in most cultures, that interrupting someone speaking is okay. In most
cases when person A interrupts person B, it means that A gets into a state where he/she thinks that what
he/she has to say is more important. There is a sudden shift into an egocentric state where immediate needs
to be heard or to make a point prevails. Time is the scarce resource that people have to share during a
conversation. When social codes allow and encourage egocentric behavoir, then it impacts how time is
allocated. It also impacts the level of depth and awareness people place in the use of this resource. A trained
group who wants to use time in a more efficient way will include silence as being part of social codes, and will
likely control the way one can interrupt another person. A good example of this practice is the [[6
agreements]].
 
## LANGUAGE

Language is what designs, separates, categorizes, discriminates. Therefore, language is not only descriptive, it
is generative. Our whole world views are built on language, language is what creates the world. “In the
beginning was the Verb” (John 1:1­5).
Building awareness on our distinctions and on our ontological relationship with reality helps us create
generative language processes made to empower at individual and collective levels.
Ontological coaching is a very powerful process to reach such places of awareness and empowerment.
 
## MONETARY SYSTEM

Money is not neutral. Make it scarce, and hierarchies will emerge in a context of competition. Make it
sufficient, and more collaboration will manifest.
The monetary system used by a given community can be architectured just like any other architecture.
Understanding money means overcoming the collective blindness process that keeps people unaware of what
it is. This is a spiritual awakening experience. Once people understand the process of money, they are
compelled to design new architectures that empower the whole community.
 
## FOOD

What kind of food do we eat? How consciously do we absorb it and digest it? What is our relationship to it?
What do we eat and not eat? Are we eating meat? Are we vegetarian/vegan or not? Do we celebrate or take
it as pure chemical stuff? Do we know where the food we eat comes from? Have we grown it or not? What
are the social customs? How is the table set? Is it social or individual? Do we touch the food? Do we cook?
How is is cooked? What is the family story around food? What is the addiction?
We see that food raises many questions that have a strong impact in our world view, individual and collective
behavior.
 
## LEGAL SYSTEM

Formal law, formal or informal agreements... We are surrounded by an infinite set of rules. Some we are
aware of, some we are not. Bringing light to it allows communities to understand many of their working
processes. It is then an invitation to build more powerful laws, agreements, rules.
 
## TIME

The way we manage our time, clocks and calendar has a strong impact on our perception of the world and our
relationship to it. Time/calendar are relationship and social shapers. See for instance the
[[http://www.tortuga.com/|13 Moon Calendar]].
