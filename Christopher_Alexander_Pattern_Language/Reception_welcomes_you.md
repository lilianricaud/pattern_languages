##Problem

Have you ever walked into a public building and been processed by the receptionist as if you were a package?


## Context / Conflicting Forces

## Solution

Arrange a series of welcoming things immediately in- side the entrance—soft chairs, a fireplace, food, coffee. Place the reception desk so that it is not between the receptionist and the welcoming area, but to one side at an angle—so that she, or he, can get up and walk toward the people who come in, greet them, and then invite them to sit down
