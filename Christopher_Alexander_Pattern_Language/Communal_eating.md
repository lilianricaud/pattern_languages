# COMMUNAL EATING

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lilianricaud/patterns/master/communal-eating-pattern-image.jpg">

## Core

Without communal eating, no human group can hold together.

Therefore, 

Give every institution and social group a place where people can eat together. Make the common meal a regular event. In particular, start a common lunch in every work place, so that a genuine meal around a common table (not out of boxes, machines, or bags) becomes an important, comfortable, and daily event with room for invited guests. In our own work group at the Center, we found this worked most beautifully when we took it in turns to cook the lunch. The lunch became an event: a gathering: something that each of us put our love and energy into, on our day to cook.

Without communal eating, no human group can hold to- gether.

T h e	importance	of	communal	eating	is	clear	in	all	human societies. Holy communion, wedding feasts, birthday parties, Christmas dinner, an Irish wake, the family evening meal are Western and Christian examples, but every society has its equivalents.	T h e r e	are	almost	no	important	human	events	or institutions which are not given their power to bind, their sacral character,	by	food	and	drink.	T h e	anthropological	literature	is full of references. For example: "Food and Its Vicissitudes: A Cross-Cultural Study of Sharing and Nonsharing," in Yehudi A. Cohen, Social Structure and Personality; A Casebook, New York:	Holt,	1 9 6 1 .	Audrey	I.	Richards,	Hunger	and	Work	in	a Savage Tribe: A Functional Study of Nutrition Among the Southern	Bantu.

Thomas Merton summarizes the meaning of communal eating beautifully:
A feast is of such a nature that it draws people to itself, and makes them leave everything else in order to participate in its joys. To feast together is to bear witness to the joy one has at being with his friends. The mere act of eating together, quite apart from a banquet or some other festival occasion, is by its very nature a sign of friendship and of "communion."
In modern times we have lost sight of the fact that even the most ordinary actions of our everyday life are invested, by their very nature, with a deep spiritual meaning. The table is in a certain sense the center of family life, the expression of family life. Here the children gather with their parents to eat the food which the love of their parents has provided. . . .

So, too, with a banquet. The Latin word convivium contains more of this mystery than our words "banquet" or "feast." To call a feast a "convivium" is to call it a "mystery of the sharing of l i f e " — a	mystery	in	which	guests	partake	of	the	good	things	prepared and given to them by the love of their host, and in which the at- mosphere of friendship and gratitude expands into a sharing of thoughts and sentiments, and ends in common rejoicing. (Thomas Merton, The Living Bread, New York, 1956, pp. 126-27.)

It is clear, then, that communal eating plays a vital role in almost all human societies as a way of binding people together and increasing the extent to which they feel like "members" of a group.

But beyond this intrinsic importance of communal eating, as a way of binding the members of a group together, there is another important reason for maintaining the pattern, which applies especially to modern metropolitan society.

Metropolitan society creates the possibility of meeting a wonderful variety of people, a possibility almost entirely new in human history. In a traditional society, one learns to live with the people he knows, but the people he knows form a relatively closed group; there is little possibility of expanding it greatly. In a modern metropolitan society, each person has the possibility of finding those few other people in the city he really wants to be with. In theory, a man in a city of five million people has the possibility of meeting just those half dozen people who are the people he most wants to be with, in all of these five million.

But this is only theory. In practice it is very hard. Few people can feci confident that they have met their closest possible companions or found the informal groups they want to belong to in the cities they inhabit. In fact, on the contrary, people com- plain constantly that they cannot meet enough people, that there are too few opportunities for meeting people. Far from being
free to explore the natures of all the people in society, and free to be together with those others who have the greatest natural and mutual affinities, instead people feel constrained to be with the few people they happen to have run into.

H o w	can	the	great	potential	of	metropolitan	society	be	real- ized? How can a person find the other people for whom he has the greatest possible affinity?
To answer this question, we must define the workings of the process	by	which	people	meet	new	people	in	society.	T h e	answer to this question hinges on the following three critical hypotheses:
1. The process hinges entirely on the overlap of the human groups in society, and the way a person can pass through these human groups, expanding his associations.
2. The process can only take place if the various human groups in society possess "group territories" where meeting can take place.
3.	T h e	process	of	meeting	seems	to	depend	especially	on	com- munal eating and drinking and therefore takes place especially well in those groups which have at least partly institutionalized common food and drink.
If these three hypotheses are correct, as we believe, then it is plain that the process by which people meet one another depends very largely on the extent to which people are able to pass from group to group, as visitors and guests, at communal meals. And this of course can happen only if each institution and each social group has its own common meals, regularly, and if its members are free to invite guests to their meals and in turn are free to be invited by the guests they meeet-to other meals at other gatherings.

Therefore:
Give every institution and social group a place where people can eat together. Make the common meal a regular event. In particular, start a common lunch in every work place, so that a genuine meal around a common table (not out of boxes, machines, or bags) becomes an important, comfortable, and daily event with room for invited guests. In our own work group at the Center, we found this worked most beautifully when we took it in turns to cook the lunch. The lunch became an event: a gathering: something that each of us put our love and energy.
