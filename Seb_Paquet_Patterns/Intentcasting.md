Interest brings groups together, but intent is what brings teams together to actually get things done.

Intentcasting is deceptively simple to describe. It consists in broadcasting your intent to make something happen. That something could be anything:

“I want to have a party at my house!”

“We want to raise $1,000 for Japan!”

“I want this piece of software to exist!”

“We want this work of art to exist!”

In order for intent to catch on, it has to meet a few conditions:

It must describe a promise – a future state of affairs that could conceivably happen, explained in a way that people understand.

It must open participation in one or more well-defined ways.

It must be expressed in a way that enables it to travel and spread over the communications infrastructure.

There must be other people or groups out there who resonate with the intent and can get excited enough to connect.
