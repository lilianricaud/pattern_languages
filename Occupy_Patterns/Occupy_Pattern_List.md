## COMITTEES
Much of the organisational structure is borrowed from the American and Spanish movements: Committees of 30 to 100 people each direct the movement’s communication, logistics, security and entertainment. 

## ORGANIZED COMMUNICATION
The communications committee maintains a stylish social media presence on Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr. The NuitDebout pages feature attractive anti-corporate graphics that could have been designed by advertising firms, and their posts carefully avoid inflammatory rhetoric.

## GENERAL ASSEMBLIES
Major decisions are made at a “general assembly” where anyone can put their name on a list to speak. People show approval by waving, and votes are decided by a simple show of hands. 

General Assemblies sometimes use mechanisme fo favor public expression of  women and underrepresented minority groups

## COMMISSIONS

Thematic workgroups.

## HAND SIGNALS
The Occupy movement hand signals are a group of hand signals used by Occupy Wall Street protesters to negotiate a consensus. Hand signals are used instead of conventional audible signals, like applause, shouts, or booing, because they do not interrupt the speaker.

## SELF RELIANCE

## SMALL CITY

## CLEAN UP
The community look after its environment and establish mechanisms to clean up.

## MARCH, 32ND

"We'll be in april when we decide it" said some signs written by 
#NuitDebout participants. They decided change the dates to march 32nd, 33rd, 34th…  demonstrating the people can change the rules if they want to. this is similar to Transition network in Totden printing 21£ notes of local money, saying " we can, so why not?"

## UNITY DIVERSITY
It's also interesting to note how the movement take advantage of the diversity of culture instead of trying to get everyone to fit in the same box.

## GLOBAL PROTOTYPING / NETWORKED INNOVATION

# Notes   
it's interesting to see how the various movement feed from each other and how quickly innovations are transferred from one country to another. This "networked innovation" all happens with in the context of open collectives where anyone can contribute.

## PLATFORM OF PARTICIPATION

The movement provides a platform for participation and prototyping.

## RADICAL INCLUSION

## NON-VIOLENT SECURITY

Open movements with RADICAL INCLUSION are very vulerable to provocative agents. Whether opponents or hidden police officers, anyone who want to discredit occupy movement can trigger violent events and blame the whole movement for that. Such open movements therefore have to find way to ensure security for themselves, yet they cannot use violence (NO VIOLENCE). In that context how can they ensure security ?

Therefore, use creative and non violent techniques such as CLOWN BRIGADES, HUG BRIGADES, people with strong physical disabilities can also help (STRATEGIC WEAKNESS, UNITY DIVERSITY) because they are weak, violent people cannot feel under threat and injuring them would be shocking for everyone around.

## STRATEGIC WEAKNESS

In NDLL, participants were fighting police with strategic weakness: half naked, they would crawl around police agents feet, making it very difficult  for police to fight them using violence.
