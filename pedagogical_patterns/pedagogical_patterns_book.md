**PPP Buttons**  
by [Joe](http://www.pedagogicalpatterns.org//people/right.html#jb)  
To gain more publicity and to "out" ourselves as PPP participants, Joe is currently designing buttons.  
Some [examples](buttons/buttons.gif) are available. Please give feedback to directly [Joe](mailto:berginf@csis.pace.edu).

**Rewriting of legacy pedagogical patterns**  
by almost all...  
There are [quite a lot of pedagogical pattern](http://www-lifia.info.unlp.edu.ar/ppp) of which we feel they should be rewritten to find out the real, essential content. Our goal is to rewrite some of them and create a pattern language for submission at the next EuroPLoP conference.  
As a result of this work, we have submitted papers to the [EuroPLoP](http://hillside.net/patterns/EuroPLoP/) and the [PLoP](http://www.hillside.net/conferences/plop.htm) conferences.
