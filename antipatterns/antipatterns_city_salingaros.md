# Anti-patterns in the contemporary city

In a misguided attempt at forced social engineering, traditional architectural and urban pattern languages were abandoned in the early twentieth century. This act was entirely deliberate, and represented ideas for a new type of city. Le Corbusier formulated his urban proposals into the Athens Charter of 1933, which was subsequently used as a blueprint for post-war urban development. There is no doubt that this reversal of traditional city structure, coupled with the elimination of connective boundaries and interfaces, was based on two false premises: (a) It is desirable to concentrate functions into giant packages; (b) The geometry within each package is homogeneous. Nevertheless, a city contains so many complex human functions that it is impossible to isolate them, let alone concentrate them, so that imposing a simplistic geometry on urban form inhibits the human activities that generate living cities.

One approach to combating the increasing congestion of nineteenth-century cities was to just streamline the geometry. That solution, which helps only in the free flow of vehicular traffic, has generated a stylistic rule responsible for disconnecting urban elements. The visual concept of "streamlining" has been adopted as a universal architectural principle, beyond its narrow application to the expressway. As a consequence, a drastic reduction in the number of different urban interfaces, which ought to exist on many different scales, has made it impossible to generate a coherent urban system. Furthermore, rejecting traditional urban patterns means that people no longer connect to buildings and cities, because human behavioral patterns cannot be contained by architectural anti-patterns (Salingaros, 2000).
