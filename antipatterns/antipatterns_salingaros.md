this approach has been used successfully by Douglas Schuller to mine for civic intelligence patterns and make people aware of the importance of patterns.


# Antipatterns by Salingaros

For Salingaros, Anti-patterns can in many instances be treated like mind-viruses, or "memes", a concept taken from the literature of biological evolution. he believes design today is hampered by anti-patterns (or mind-viruses, otherwise called "memes") that impose unnatural forms and shapes on the environment. These will prevent the application of design patterns, which offer the only way to create a living environment.

## How patterns are displaced by anti-patterns ?

The word "meme" denotes a transferable unit of information that propagates itself by going from human mind to human mind 6 . In direct analogy with the spread of a virus, a meme is an idea, a description of something, or a visual image or snippet of music. Once released into the collective human mind pool, it is picked up by someone, and then passed on to the population at large by imitation. The success of a meme depends on its efficiency to replicate, and has nothing to do with its beneficial or harmful aspects to its hosts: human minds.

An unsuccessful meme simply does not spread, and may die off, or linger on marginally. A successful meme infects
the population in an exponential fashion, and could just as easily be replaced by a more virulent competing
meme

Human language -- both spoken words, and the pictorial language of images -- quite possibly drove the brain to
expand fourfold in order to accommodate the increase in information input. The problem is that destructive memes
also use the replicating process intrinsic in the human mind to propagate themselves throughout a population.
We apparently have no defenses against virulent memes, and cannot distinguish between them and benign memes.
A frightening picture emerges of human beings being manipulated by inanimate pieces of information that, like
viruses, care only for increasing their number at the expense of their human hosts. Major human catastrophes
can be attributed to, or are certainly helped by, a destructive meme that spreads to the population and
drives it to do what it does unquestioningly.

A meme is more like a simple visual image rather than a reasoned description of how something is made.

Successful memes are very easy to remember. A collection of simple memes could pretend to form a language, which could itself be perfectly consistent internally; nevertheless, they cannot coexist with a pattern language that respects complexity. The best example comes from government. Fascism and totalitarianism clean up the messiness of human society by displacing our most deeply-held patterns of human values. They have an undeniable appeal, however, otherwise they would not take over the collective mind of nations every few decades. Each time that happens, people again fool themselves into believing the demagogues who tell them that life's complexities can be drastically simplified.

The Structure of Pattern Languages derives a definite (fractal) geometry for urban interfaces, such as is found
both in traditional cities, and unplanned human settlements and favelas in the third world. The twentieth
century saw a deliberate reversal of traditional design rules so as to allow novel forms to be produced. People
have argued at great length for or against this transition, but the discussion has always taken place purely on a
stylistic level. Urban boundaries influence the activity matrix of people in cities. A boundary's geometry is
determined by fundamental processes, and if this geometry is tampered with, it inhibits the everyday
actions that contribute to make a successful city.

I believe that the imposition of a simplistic geometry on city form, by suppressing more traditional patterns, has
curtailed or eliminated the traditional functions of a city that make it alive. Contemporary design philosophy gets
rid of connective interfaces altogether. A deeper problem arises out of the modernist desire to visually "purify"
areas by eliminating complex structure, subdivisions, and connections. Consolidation of functions by concentrating
them geometrically eliminates the complex mixing that characterizes a traditional city. In our times, urbanists
intentionally de-couple urban elements by separating them spatially.

The twentieth century has invented urban boundaries that are very bad interfaces. Many of these are made possible by technological developments that were unavailable in traditional cities. Urbanists have created a new set of rules that are used to define urban interfaces.

The interfaces of twentieth-century cities prevent most of the activities that occurred there in previous times.
People have been taught by schools, critics, and magazines to prefer smooth, unnatural edges and boundaries over ones with fractal scaling that resemble natural structures. Architecture schools instill a precise, sleek image of the world into our culture.

## Anti-patterns that destroy urban interfaces.

Most of the known architectural and urban anti-patterns were created by Charles-Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier). Characteristic of all viruses, there is no completeness in the sense that we have an organism that metabolizes and interacts with others in an ecosystem. 

What we have is a nonliving informational code, or meme, whose sole purpose is to reproduce itself. For this reason,
a mind-virus is given as a simple image, and not as a formula or solution to a problem. I have noted below
some of the most destructive urban anti-patterns. These have infected the minds of people alive today, and work to
displace patterns from the collective subconscious. This is the reason why it is extremely difficult to reintroduce
Alexandrine patterns back into today's society.

This list underlines my point. There is no scientific support for any of these twelve anti-patterns, despite the
false claims made by Le Corbusier, and repeated later by his apologists. Scientific investigation of human
interactions proves that these twelve anti-patterns prevent the normal activity in a city that drives people to inhabit urban regions in the first place. Anti-patterns become so deeply embedded into a culture, however, that
any questioning of them threatens many people's essential being. Those persons are certainly unwilling to
admit that they have allowed themselves to be infected with mind-viruses. Their mind is their self, and so they
will defend their prejudices as forcefully as they will defend their life 6 .

Taken as a set of working rules, the above dozen anti- patterns have been used in a method of urban design to build cities throughout the world. They combine well together, and support each other. They have a consistency which is mistaken for adaptivity 3 . Because of this consistency, they give a result that is standard and easily identifiable: it is the modernist anti-city that treats human beings as emotionless machines. 

In a recent essay 7 , Michael Mehaffy and I argue that the application of modernist urban anti-patterns around the world, by erasing the traditional urban fabric, is in part responsible for the rage the non-industrialized world feels against the industrialized nations.

## MONTONOUS REPETITION

Social housing, everywhere, is invariably built by following the principle of monotonous repetition (Salingaros, 2011a). But this simple geometrical ordering precludes adaptation to locality, climate, solar orientation, inclusion of usable urban space, etc. It solves only one problemâ€”cost-cutting through repeating the same design endlessly. But it ends up creating an inhuman living environment. Monotonously repeating forms cannot satisfy
the multiple emotional and physical needs of the occupants;
