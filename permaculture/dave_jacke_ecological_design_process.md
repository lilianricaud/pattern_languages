# Dave Jacke’s Ecologicial Design Process

# LIVING DESIGN PROCESS

Like the forest, the design process is complex and multilayered, yet both have structure. Certain principles and “archetypal” activities undergird every effective design process, yet each trip through it is unique.3





## FIRST IMPRESSIONS

When doing professional design, it is good to observe undirectedly first thing, before you know much about a client’s site or goals. You can have such valuable first impressions only once!

### LONG AND THOUGHTFUL OBSERVATION

### GUT FEELING

One aspect of what Dave did that I noticed, in addition to making a few notes and quietly contemplating the space, was tuning into his gut feelings about different areas, the way a fence cut through one ridge, and so on.

As my currently favourite design writer, Christopher Alexander, has put it, the intellect is too crude of a net to catch the whole.

use whole body-mind as a way of finding inconsistencies or conflicts

## GOALS ARTICULATION

Design your forest garden in the context of clear self-understanding concerning what you seek to create…

Use a two-page statement under the titles or subareas Dave uses:

- Value statement
- Goals
- Opportunities
- Criteria

Which as you can see move from the general to the specific.

 the word “articulation.” Dave uses this word at the top level for this whole bit of the process rather than “statement” or something else and I had been aware that a reason for this was that the word “articulate” somehow brings more of the whole body-mind into the process. “Statement” on the other hand feels like in can flow straight from the conscious mind, thereby missing a very important source (i.e., gut/heart feeling).

this meaning of articulate is equally integral to his sense of goals articulation, where part of what you are doing is not just tapping into the whole body-mind (what do the clients really want, deep down), but working with what comes out to refine and clarify its structure and organisation. Not just running with what comes out on the first pass but probing it, removing redundancy, sorting the wheat from the chaff (or the apples from the coddling moth larvae, as the case may be).

### CLARIFIED RELATIONSHIPS

clarifying relations. For instance sometimes one goal is high level and implies or includes others.


## LIMITING FACTORS

from experience that every client-site ensemble has one or three primary limiting factors that each step of the design process has to take into consideration. So I was really happy to find Dave spending plenty of time and focus on things like wind, frost, & maintenance.

## BOUNDARIES

## SITE ANALYSIS & ASSESSMENT

themed and rigorous site analysis and assessment (again carefully chosen language from Dave here – analysing and assessing are different but complementary)

One thing I didn’t ask Dave was how long he would have had in an ideal world, but I reckon it would have been at least a few days or a week just for site analysis and assessment.

## DESIGN PROPER

Design is fundamentally messy. We learn useful things when we take it apart and put order to it, but we also risk fooling ourselves into thinking that the process is clean, linear, and organized.

Living design process : assume we are wrong and taking steps to reduce the wrongness before moving on is one critical key step toward such.

### CONCEPT DESIGN

Resolve the basic patterns and large-scale issues first.

For Dave the concept design is kind of the first glimmer that arises of a high-level whole-site pattern or layout. 

### SCHEMATIC DESIGN

SCHEMATIC DESIGN expands the seed of the CONCEPT DESIGN to see how it manifests in somewhat greater detail… (Edible Forest Gardens, VII, p. 233)

in addition to refining the points of distinction between the main areas in the concept design (camping, nut grove, clearing, edible forest garden/s) we started tuning into a couple of critical high-level decisions/distinctions as to the way that the future driveway will wrap through the space, and the location of the planned future teaching building.

DO not lock anything in prematurely

the worst design mistakes are ALWAYS made at the schematic level.  Getting the rough relationships right there is critical.  This is the stage where Type 1 errors are made, and no amount of fiddling at the detailed level will fix them.  Particularly in the short time I had, I wanted to make sure the patterns were good.  The details would evolve a lot over time anyway.


### DETAILLED / PATCH DESIGN
