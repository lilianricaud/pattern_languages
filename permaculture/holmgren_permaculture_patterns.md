# HOLMGREN PERMACULTURE PATTERNS

Mollison way of describing pattern is ecologically oriented but it is too complex for beginners to understand fully and they get confused. Therefore, Holmgren use a structure to make it easier for beginners to grasp the core: 

## HOLMGREN PATTERNS

### ACTION TITLE 

 describe the pattern in a simple language easy to refer to using a verb of action; 

### POETIC STORY/COLLECTIVE WISDOM STORY: 

a short sentence that summarize the core of the pattern in a practical way any farmer or other person can intuitivelly grasp. 

### SUMMARY: describes the core of the pattern in a positive way, not far from Alexander's way of writting patterns. 

### VISUAL ELEMENT: makes it easier to remember the pattern and more appealing. 

### FLOWER OF PERMACULTURE is metaphorical way of compiling all the patterns described by Holmgren.

## HOLMGREN GENERATIVE SEQUENCE

Holmgren principles are closer to a generative sequence than simple patterns. By following these principles, one has a simple process anyone can understand and apply to start a generative process leading to permaculture systeme establishment 

### Principle 1: OBSERVE AND INTERACT

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder

Good design depends on a free and harmonious relationship between nature and people, in which careful observation and thoughtful interaction provide the design inspiration, repertoire and patterns. It is not something that is generated in isolation, but through continuous and reciprocal interaction with the subject.

### Principle 2: CATCH AND STORE ENERGY

Make hay while the sun shines

We live in a world of unprecedented wealth resulting from the harvesting of the enormous storages of fossil fuels created by the earth over billions of years. We have used some of this wealth to increase our harvest of the Earth's renewable resources to an unsustainable degree. Most of the adverse impacts of this over-harvesting will show up as available fossil fuels decline. In financial language, we have been living by consuming global capital in a reckless manner that would send any business bankrupt.

Principle 3: OBTAIN A YIELD

You can’t work on an empty stomach

This principle reminds us that we should design any system to provide for self-reliance at all levels (including ourselves), by using captured and stored energy effectively to maintain the system and capture more energy. More broadly, flexibility and creativity in finding new ways to obtain a yield will be critical in the transition from growth to descent.

### Principle 4: APPLY SELF-REGULATION AND ACCEPT FEEDBACK

The sins of the fathers are visited on the children unto the seventh generation

This principle deals with self-regulatory aspects of permaculture design that limit or discourage inappropriate growth or behaviour. With better understanding of how positive and negative feedbacks work in nature, we can design systems that are more self-regulating, thus reducing the work involved in repeated and harsh corrective management.

### Principle 5: USE AND VALUE RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND SERVICES

Let nature take its course

Renewable resources are those that are renewed and replaced by natural processes over reasonable periods, without the need for major non-renewable inputs. In the language of business, renewable resources should be seen as our sources of income, while non-renewable resources can be thought of as capital assets. Spending our capital assets for day-to-day living is unsustainable in anyone's language. Permaculture design should aim to make best use of renewable natural resources to manage and maintain yields, even if some use of non-renewable resources is needed in establishing systems.

### Principle 6: PRODUCE NO WASTE

Waste not, want not A stitch in time saves nine 

This principle brings together traditional values of frugality and care for material goods, the modern concern about pollution, and the more radical perspective that sees wastes as resources and opportunities. The earthworm is a suitable icon for this principle because it lives by consuming plant litter (wastes), which it converts into humus that improves the soil environment for itself, for soil micro-organisms, and for the plants. Thus the earthworm, like all living things, is a part of a web where the outputs of one are the inputs for another.

### Principle 7: DESIGN FROM PATTERNS TO DETAILS

Can’t see the wood for the trees

The first six principles tend to consider systems from the bottom-up perspective
of elements, organisms, and individuals. The second six principles tend to emphasise the top-down perspective of the patterns and relationships that tend to emerge by system self-organisation and co-evolution. The commonality of patterns observable in nature and society allows us to not only make sense of what we see, but to use a pattern from one context and scale, to design in another. Pattern recognition is an outcome of the application of Principle 1: Observe and interact, and is the necessary precursor to the process of design. In every aspect of nature, from the internal workings of organisms to whole ecosystems, we find the connections between things are as important as the things themselves. Thus the purpose of a functional and self-regulating design is to place elements in such a way that each serves the needs and accepts the products of other elements. This principle focuses more closely on the different types of relationships that draw elements together in more closely integrated systems, and on improved methods of designing communities of plants, animals and people to gain benefits from these relationships.

### Principle 8: INTEGRATE RATHER THAN SEGREGATE

Many hands make light work.
In every aspect of nature, from the internal workings of organisms to whole ecosystems, we find the connections between things are as important as the things themselves. Thus the purpose of a functional and self-regulating design is to place elements in such a way that each serves the needs and accepts the products of other elements.

### Principle 9: USE SMALL AND SLOW SOLUTIONS
The bigger they are, the harder they fall Slow and steady wins the race 

Systems should be designed to perform functions at the smallest scale that is practical and energy-efficient for that function. Human scale and capacity should be the yardstick for a humane, democratic and sustainable society. This principle is reasonably well understood as a result of the pioneering work of E. F. Schumacher. Whenever we do anything of a self-reliant nature - growing food, fixing a broken appliance, maintaining our health, we are making very powerful and effective use of this principle. Whenever we purchase from small, local businesses or contribute to local community and environmental issues, we are also applying this principle.

### Principle 10: USE AND VALUE DIVERSITY
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.
The great diversity of forms, functions and interactions in nature and humanity are the source of evolved systemic complexity. The role and value of diversity in nature, culture and permaculture is itself complex, dynamic, and at times apparently contradictory. Diversity needs to be seen as a result of the balance and tension in nature between variety and possibility on the one hand, and productivity and power on the other.

### Principle 11: USE EDGES AND VALUE THE MARGINAL

Don’t think you are on the right track just because it is a well-beaten path
This principle works from the premise that the value and contribution of edges, and the marginal and invisible aspects of any system should not only be recognized and conserved, but that expansion of these aspects can increase system productivity and stability. For example, increasing the edge between field and pond can increase the productivity of both. Alley farming and shelterbelt forestry can be seen as systems where increasing edge between field and forest has contributed to productivity.

### Principle 12: CREATIVELY USE AND RESPOND TO CHANGE

Vision is not seeing things as they are but as they will be
This principle has two threads: designing to make use of change in a deliberate and co-operative way, and creatively responding or adapting to large-scale system change which is beyond our control or influence. The acceleration of ecological succession within cultivated systems is the most common expression of this principle in permaculture literature and practice, and illustrates the first thread. Permaculture is about the durability of natural living systems and human culture, but this durability paradoxically depends in large measure on flexibility and change. In any particular system, the small-scale, fast, short-lived changes of the elements actually contribute to higher-order system stability. We live and design in a historical context of turnover and change in systems at multiple larger scales, and this generates a new illusion of endless change with no possibility of stability or sustainability. A contextual and systemic sense of the dynamic balance between stability and change contributes to design that is evolutionary rather than random.
