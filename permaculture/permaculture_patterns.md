# MOLLISON PERMACULTURE PATTERNS

These are patternS described by Bill Mollison. Note that these differ slightly from other principles described by Holmgren later on. Unfortunately in the article about permaculture, Wikipedia editors only mention the former.

## RELATIVE LOCATION		
every element is placed in relationship to another so that they assist each other.

## MULTIFUNCTIONALITY

each element performs many functions

http://deepgreenpermaculture.com/permaculture/permaculture-design-principles/2-each-element-performs-many-functions/

## FUNCTIONAL REDUNDANCY 


each important  function is supported by many elements

## ZONES 

Efficient energy planning
zone planning, sector planning, use of slope and naturally occuring energies, movements, behaviors

## SECTORS

## BIOLOGICAL RESSOURCES
machine breaks, require energy & materials to build and maintain,		emphasis on the use of biological ressources over fossil fuel ressources or machines.

## ENERGY CYCLING
energy recycling on site (both fuel and human)

## SMALL SCALE INTENSIVE SYSTEMS

## STACKING
space stacking + time stacking



## ACCELERATED SUCCESSION AND EVOLUTION

Using and accelerating natural cycles to establish favourable environment

## DIVERSITY

monoculture has many problems associated with it		

Therefore, 

Maximize diversity of people, places, species for a productive interactive system

http://deepgreenpermaculture.com/permaculture/permaculture-design-principles/9-diversity/

## EDGE EFFECT

When two different environment meet there is maximal potential for productivity. Maximize interface between different people or place to increase diveristy and yields

## ATTITUDE

### Everything works both ways

a problem can be used creativelly to find an elegant solution. If the problem is an excess of something, can it be used productively elsewhere ?

### Intensive Information and Imagination

"our yields are determined by the the quality of thought and information we use, not the size and quality of our system. To use our resources in the most efficient and productive ways possible, we need to be able to access and process information to make the best decisions about how we design our system.

Information is a critical key resource. It comes in the form of knowledge and experience, ideas, and the learning of multitudes of people who have come before us.

It is only when we take the time to observe, contemplate, discuss, read and learn that we can truly think from a multidisciplinary perspective, and ultimately design systems which really save energy and provide significant yields."

### Outputs become inputs
normal elements or system produce output. When this outputs are not used and accumulate, they can become detrimental to the system and their potential is wasted		Create links between elements so that the ouput of one is use as an input for another
