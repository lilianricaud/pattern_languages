# THEORIES OF CHANGE PATTERNS

This pattern language draft is based on a paper proposing theories of change for sustainability science and reviewing ten propositions on how to leverage the potentials and to confront the challenges of working with ToCs in sustainability science. The content has been dapated in a pattern language format to highlight essentials concepts, knowledge gaps and the link between them.

## THEORIES OF CHANGE

Theories of change (ToCs) are defined as the **mental representations and theoretical assumptions that explain how and why activities of an initiative** (e. g., projects, programmes, organizations) **generate particular changes**.

they generally trigger debate among stakeholders and/or evaluators of an initiative regarding the hypothesized and observed effects of actions as well as regarding underlying assumptions about how change happens.

These assumptions can be critically reflected on over time (EXPLICIT CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS), PROJECT ACTIVITIES can be adapted according to the actual experiences of implementation. Thus, ToCs are not only theories but also modes of knowledge production among stakeholders and/or evaluators of an initiative to scrutinize, plan, monitor and reflect on whether, how, and why particular activities of an initiative trigger particular changes.

ToCs can serve to generate a SHARED UNDERSTANDING among involved actors regarding PATHWAYS to impact initiatives for SYSTEMIC CHANGE.
ToCs feature seven important components:
1. They start from a goal/problem (SHARED GOALS) in a particular context,
2. they diagnose CONTEXTUALIZED CAUSES of CHALLENGES (DIAGNOSES), and
3. explain how TRANSFORMATIONS in the system of concern unfold.
4. They characterize what the ROLE OF KNOWLEDGE in this process might be, and
5. specify ACTIVITIES and PATHWAYS that lead to intended OUTCOMES and IMPACTS (KNOWLEDGE GAPS).
6. They may further hypothesize how actors acquire new or adapt existing knowledge, or how they learn from each other (ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING PROCESS).
7. Moreover, they depict epistemological assumptions (EXPLICIT CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS), including ideas regarding what constitutes “good actions”, what constitutes appropriate roles for various stakeholders, and how each disciplinary knowledge relates to other forms of knowledge (SHARED LANGUAGE).

In short, ToCs in interdisciplinary project articulate the relations between goals (SHARED GOALS), DIAGNOSES, KNOWLEDGE GAPS, CONTEXT CONDITIONS, ACTIVITIES, PATHWAYS to impact, and epistemological assumptions (EXPLICIT CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS).

Central activities are MULTI-STAKEHOLDERS PROCESSES, JOINT DATA GENERATION AND VERIFICATION, and TECHNICAL CAPACITY BUILDING. PROGRESSES and CHALLENGES are regularly assessed against this ToC.



## MEANINGFUL AND ATTAINABLE GOALS / SHARED GOALS

*ToCs facilitate the development of meaningful and attainable project goals.*

it is critical that **project stakeholders formulate and share ownership of goals and transformative pathways based on an explicit ethical stance**.

ToC process enables deliberation in groups, and furthers the formulation and reflection of context-specific, just, legitimate, and realistic goals.


## EXPLICIT CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS

*ToCs facilitate project planning by explicitly articulating critical assumptions regarding the links of the project with societal transformations.*

Joint development of a ToC **forces project members to diagnose as precisely as possible the current state of the system, including perceptions of it**. 

Building on this diagnosis, the ToC development process urges them to **develop explicit hypotheses about how intended transformations could unfold**.

Through in-depth dialogue, the **tacit knowledge and implicit suppositions of actors become explicit and debatable**. 

Scientific theories of societal transformation can reinforce or correct claims about transformations and the potential roles of the project therein. ToCs **highlight the activities that are particularly critical to realize transformative ambitions**. This aids in formulating, fine-tuning, and sequencing project activities. It also helps in developing risk management strategies and allocating staff and financial resources in view of goals and pathways to impacts. Identification of risks and respective mitigation strategies was included in many of the projects reviewed. However, we found no commonly agreed way of using ToC in project planning, and projects varied in the level of sophistication of their ToCs.

## CONTINOUS REFLECTION PROCESS

*ToCs must be embedded in a continuous reflection process to remain adaptive and embrace surprises.*

Rapidly changing contexts often require realignment of project designs. ToCs must also remain adaptive. Once elaborated and agreed upon, ToCs provide a mental model representing a project approach at a given time. However, tension can arise between the explicit knowledge formalized in ToCs and the evolving tacit knowledge generated in the day-to-day practices of project members. 

Therefore, 

**To remain a useful tool over time, formalized ToCs require ongoing critical reflection and adjustments to ensure that they meaningfully reflect new conditions, new information, and can update strategies.**

We found that this occurred especially in long term projects (five to ten years), in which regular internal and external project reviews could be organized, creating space for processes of reflection.

## NON-LINEARITY ASSUMPTION / SYSTEMIC EFFECTS

*The ToC process must embrace non-linearity and unintended effects.*

We have a tendency to depict linear relationships between activities and outputs, outcomes, and impacts. Often we are focusing too much on optimistic scenarios, while disregarding unintended effects. However, in complex systems, linearity and causality between activity and impact can only be established in very narrow subsystems. In the course of many interventions, linear models and optimistic expectations are disrupted by unforeseen contingencies, emergent outcomes, feedback loops, and counter-movements. 


Therefore,

**Projects must conduct critical assessments of potential unintended effects.** 

Our review identified complementary tools such as stakeholder mapping, SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis, and participatory scenario building as useful in this regard. 

To embrace the non-linearity of transformations, one of the reviewed initiatives rooted their ToC in adaptive governance. Results showed that ToCs are best embedded in a CONTINOUS REFLECTION PROCESS, rather than a static workplan. 

## SYSTEMIC THINKING

**fuse with NON-LINEARITY ASSUMPTION / SYSTEMIC EFFECTS ???**

many ToCs have also been criticized for falling back into linear thinking.

Nevertheless, if integrated in a process of critical reflection (CONTINOUS REFLECTION PROCESS) and learning (ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING PROCESS), ToCs can support adaptive planning, implementation, learning, and evaluation at project and organizational levels.


## SYSTEMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES AND INDICATORS

*ToCs support continuous critical reflection and learning by providing indicators and procedures for project evaluation.*

Metrics for evaluating transdisciplinary research are important. Spelling out the pathways to impacts can point to important indicators and procedures that go beyond traditionnal non systemic metrics (such as scientific publications and citations).

monitoring project progress against a formulated ToC enables critical reflection (CONTINOUS REFLECTION PROCESS) and validation of assumptions about how change happens and why progress does or does not work out. This helps to improve the performance of ongoing projects, but also aids formulation of more promising ToCs for future projects.

carefully facilitated stakeholder meetings successfully enhance solution finding through open dialogue in which participants strive to understand each other’s perspectives, rather than fight for their own interests.

## REAL LIFE POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS

Hidden agendas and power asymmetries can jeopardize success, and thus demand special attention when planning
knowledge co-production.

Once project participants return to their “real life” institutional settings, shaped by strategic reasoning and established power relations, they might change the positions defended earlier or even veto agreement reached earlier. 

Therefore,

**In order to achieve project goals, focus more on existing power relationships outside the stakeholder meetings and take them into account when working on solutions/actions.** 

## ATTRIBUTION/KNOWLEDGE GAPS

*ToCs help address attribution gaps, while acknowledging that unknowns will remain.*

Virtually every initiative confronts factors beyond its control, for example concerning societal agreement or learning beyond the project’s reach. Moreover, outcomes frequently emerge from many concurrent dynamics and activities. Attribution of outcomes to a single project thus systematically faces an attribution gap.  Without a ToC, discussions of impact may remain vague and the corresponding analysis may emphasize short-term results lacking transformative potential. ToCs can reduce, but not eliminate, the problem of causal attribution.

Therefore, 

**Create a space for in-depth discussion among project stakeholders about causal effects – stipulated in a mutually agreed ex ante ToC – supports deliberative evaluations of whether, how, and why a project had an impact as well as what other factors may have had an impact.**

Discussion of impact pathways can be supported by a ToC that structures the analysis, and facilitates naming of unknowns as they crop up. 


## UPDATED ASSUMPTIONS

*The ToC process can aid team building.*

While ToCs are typically formulated at the start of a project, changing team compositions and advances in implementation can lead to diverging ideas among project members about how change happens in the project context. This is especially the case in multi disciplinary and multicultural settings. 

Therefore,

Devote time to reflect upon, and update, shared or distinct assumptions about how change happens to help recognize and address diverging views within teams. This process can strengthen teams by consolidating a collectively created perspective and clarifying the different roles and activities of project members. For this reason, several of the projects reviewed invested considerable resources in joint ToC reviews. They were found to enable shared understanding among diverse and geographically distributed team members.


## SHARED GOALS

*ToC practice requires enabling operational conditions.*

ToCs are resource-intensive due to their continuous, participatory character. As noted, ToCs are especially useful if elaborated collaboratively and employed in an ongoing process of critical reflection and learning. This requires that project members and stakeholders are willing and able to spend sufficient time and resources actively engaging in the process. 
Our review showed that ToC use was particularly successful when projects explicitly budgeted and planned the process in advance, and agreed on joint meetings from the beginning. Nevertheless, we also found that joint elaboration of ToCs with all project stakeholders, often from different backgrounds, can be challenging, and compromise may be necessary to agree on goals. **Indeed, establishing shared goals is essential to developing ToCs that can be used to generate transformation knowledge.**

## SHARED LANGUAGE WORKSHOPS

**ToCs help to shape the interfaces between disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary activities.**

ToCs can support joint transdisciplinary programming by engaging project stakeholders in an in-depth discussion of project activities, pathways to impacts, assumptions about change, KNOWLEDGE GAPS, and expected outcomes. ToCs may provide a shared object for debates between scientific and societal actors, helping them build a joint, cumulative understanding of how and why particular activities did or did not produce particular changes. Nevertheless, ToC processes alone are seldom sufficient to overcome underlying epistemological differences between stakeholders from different disciplines. 

In some of the reviewed cases, targeted workshops were necessary to address and jointly define the conceptual foundation of a given transdisciplinary endeavour.


## ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING PROCESS


*ToCs can facilitate cumulative learning at organizational levels.*

The ToC approach can provide organization-level benefits when embedded in an organizational learning process involving larger numbers of similar projects. Deliberations on ToCs at the organizational level can be useful in two ways: first, for individuals within organizations, ToCs can enable mutual learning between staff conducting similar activities and using similar ToCs in different contexts, thereby promoting self-reflexive learning processes. Second, for organizations as a unit, longer-term learning processes regarding the validity of specific ToCs can help to build detailed, cumulative organizational knowledge about how, why, and under what conditions specific activities are effective or not. Such experience can refine organization-level ToCs reflecting the contextual and practical nuances of different contexts and activities in which an organization is engaged. Moreover, organization-level ToCs can support members in gaining greater clarity about the pathways and
critical assumptions of the organization’s mission. Complementing individual job descriptions and organizational missions with a ToC can help members reflect on their own roles and competencies within the organization’s setup

# THEORIES OF CHANGE PROCESS

Adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_change#Basic_structure

## IDENTIFY LONG TERM GOAL

identifying a workable long-term goal and long-term outcomes. The long-term goal should be something the initiative can realistically achieve and that everyone involved understands.

## IDENTIFY PATHWAY / CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESS

Once a long-term goal is identified, the group then considers: “What conditions must be in place for us to reach the goal? Any such necessary conditions should be shown as outcomes on the Theory of Change pathway, underneath the long-term outcome.

## DRILL DOWN PATHWAY

These outcomes act as preconditions to the long-term outcome. The process of identifying preconditions continues, drilling down the pathway by posing fundamental questions such as: “What has to be in place for this outcome to be achieved?” and “Are these preconditions sufficient for the outcome to be achieved?” 

## DEFINE INDICATORS

The ultimate success of any Theory of Change lies in its ability to demonstrate progress on the achievement of outcomes. Evidence of success confirms the theory and indicates that the initiative is effective. Therefore, the outcomes in a Theory of Change must be coupled with indicators that guide and facilitate measurement. 

Indicators may be said to operationalize the outcomes – that is, they make the outcomes understandable in concrete, observable and measurable terms. The relationship of indicator to outcome can be confusing and may be clarified with this simple formula: “I’ll know [outcome reached] when I see [indicator].” For example, “I’ll know that teenagers in the program understand the prenatal nutrition and health guidelines when I see program participants identifying foods that are good sources of nutrition.” Ideally, every outcome on the outcomes pathway (below the dashed accountability ceiling) should have an indicator, but available resources often make that difficult to do.

Just as development of a Theory of Change is a participatory process, a ToC-based monitoring and evaluation system can be designed in a participatory way. For example, grant managers can be involved in choosing the outcomes of greatest interest to them in their decision-making. Similarly, people on the ground can have input into which indicators to use and how to operationalize them, choices of instruments and methods of data collection, and which existing sources of data may be used in tracking indicators.
