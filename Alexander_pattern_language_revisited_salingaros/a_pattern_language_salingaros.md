# 12 Patterns for space

## Pattern 61: Small Public Squares. 

Build public squares with a width of approximately 60 feet. Their length can vary. The walls enclosing the space, whether partially or wholly surrounding it, should make us feel as if we are in a large open public room.

## Pattern 106: Positive Outdoor Space. 

The built structures partially surrounding an outdoor space, be it rectangular or circular, must define, in its wall elements, a concave perimeter boundary, making the space itself convex overall.

## Pattern 115: Courtyards Which Live. 

The best courtyards have many entry points, a view to the streets beyond, and enclosing walls that are fenestrated, not blank.These are used most often.

## Pattern 124: Activity Pockets. 

The success of urban space depends on what can occur along its boundaries. A space will be lively only if there are pockets of activity all around its inner edges.

## Pattern 167: Six-Foot Balcony. 

The minimum depth of social space for a balcony is six feet, preferably with its space partly enclosed, either canopied, protected from nearby observers by side screens, or partly recessed into the facade. Recessed
balconies provide an excellent sense of enclosure. But if balconies are narrower than six feet (going out), are totally exposed or entirely cantilevered, they are rarely used.

## Pattern 179: Alcoves. 

To heighten the sense of intimacy indoors, build a useful smaller space within a larger space, partially enclosed with concave boundaries and a lower ceiling. Its width and depth could both be approximately six feet.

## Pattern 180: Window Place. 

A concave boundary can incorporate windows. Examples range from (small) a window seat where the wall is deepened to create a space around the window, to (medium) a bay window where windows wrap around an extruded portion of the space, to (large) a glazed alcove where windows partially wrap around a room.

## Pattern 183: Workspace Enclosure. 

The best place for working has no more than 50 to 75 percent of its perimeter enclosed by walls or windows. A workspace needs at least 60 square feet of floor area for each person.

## Pattern 188: Bed Alcove. 

Give the bed its own partial enclosure. The space should feel comfortable, not too small, with a lower ceiling than the main part of the bedroom.

## Pattern 190: Ceiling Height Variety. 

Give a building’s rooms different ceiling heights to enhance comfort at every scale of activity. High ceilings contribute to formality, low ceilings to informality, with the lowest height for the greater intimacy
of alcoves.

## Pattern 191: The Shape of Indoor Space. 

Indoor space should be roughly rectangular in plan with straight, vertical walls for practicality, but with concave wall portions where possible, and a roughly symmetrical vaulted ceiling. One-sided, sloped ceilings and sharp, slanted, or re-entrant angles in walls generate discomfort.

## Pattern 203: Child Caves. 

Create small “cave-like” spaces in a house, or outside,
for children to experience and play in.

# Five patterns on gardens and parks

## PATTERN 60: ACCESSIBLE GREEN. 

People will only use green spaces when those are very close to where they live and work, accessible by a pedestrian path.

## PATTERN 111: HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN. 

For a garden to be used, it must not be too exposed by being out front, nor completely hidden by being in the back.

## PATTERN 171: TREE PLACES. 

Trees shape social places, so shape buildings around existing trees, and plant new trees to generate a usable, inviting urban space.

## PATTERN 172: GARDEN GROWING WILD. To be useful, a garden must be closer to growing wild, according to
nature’s rules, than conforming to an artificial image.

## PATTERN 176: GARDEN SEAT. 
One cannot enjoy a garden if it does not have a semi-secluded place to sit and contemplate the plant growth.

# 12 Patterns for urban interface

## Pattern 124: Activity Pockets
Public space only works if its edges contain successful
pedestrian nodes 

## Pattern 166: Gallery Surround
GALLERY SURROUND proposes that people should be able to walk through a connecting zone such as a balcony to feel
connected to the outside world.

## Pattern 122: Building Fronts
BUILDING FRONTS define the life at the built edge of a street, while uniform set-backs 'almost always destroy the value of the open areas between the buildings'.

## Pattern 165: Opening to the Street
provides a connection between the pavements and the functions inside buildings. OPENING TO THE STREET is the corollary of GALLERY SURROUND: people on a pavement should feel connected to functions inside a building, made possible by direct openings.

## Pattern 160: Building Edge
should be such as to encourage life, creating pedestrian nodes and the necessarily crinkly, crenellated geometry that they require.

## Pattern 121: Path Shape
requires pedestrian nodes along a path, and these will deform
any straight edges into a more fractal form.

## Pattern 119: Arcades
provide a transition between building interiors and the world outside. ARCADES connect the inside of buildings with the world
outside via an intermediate partially-enclosed space;
without them, the transition is too abrupt.

## Pattern 108: Connected Buildings
(#108) create both a restricted access boundary and a path along it
which is destroyed by having intermediate space between the buildings.

## Pattern 53: Main Gateways
give significance - by defining access - to what would otherwise be a useless space between buildings

## Pattern 42: Industrial Ribbon
forms a way of creating a wide boundary for separating groups of
other types of buildings

## Pattern 15: Neighbourhood Boundary
stresses the necessity for containment in a living city, and show how one zone can destroy an adjoining zone if the appropriate boundaries are absent.

## Pattern 13:Subculture Boundary
is similar
