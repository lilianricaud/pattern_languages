# PLACEMAKING

The art of evolving public spaces into "COMMUNITY PLACES."


---

# COMMUNITY PLACES
"you're creating a place, not a design".

Although similar words, "spaces" and "places" have very different meanings. A space is a physical description of a piece of land, whereas a "place" connotes an emotional attachment to the piece of land.

# COMMUNITY EXPERTISE

"The community is the expert". People who use a public space regularly provide the most valuable perspective and insights into how the area functions. They also can help identify issues that are important to consider in improving the space. Uncovering and incorporating their ideas and talents is essential to creating a successful and vital community place.

# USER-CENTERED DESIGN

# CO-CREATION

Co-creation aims to dig out COMMUNITY EXPERTISE

---

# SHARED VISION

Develop a vision. A vision for a public space addresses its character, activities, uses, and meaning in the community. This vision should be defined by the people who live or work in or near the space.

# MEANING

---

# PARTNERS

"You can't do it alone."
A good public space requires partners who contribute innovative ideas, financial or political support, and help plan activities. Partners also can also broaden the impact of a civic space by coordinating schedules for programming and improvement projects.

---

# OBSERVATION

You can see a lot just by observing. People will often go to extraordinary lengths to adapt a place to suit their needs. A raised curb can be used as a place to sit, sort mail, and even— believe it or not—cook clams. Observing a space allows you to learn how the space is used.

---

# TRIANGULATION

The concept of triangulation relates to locating elements next to each other in a way that fosters activity. For example, a bench, trash receptacle, and coffee kiosk placed near a bus stop create synergy because they are more convenient for waiting bus passengers and pedestrians than if they
were isolated from each other.

---

# OPEN-ENDED PROCESS

"You are never finished". About 80 percent of the success of any public space can be attributed to its MANAGEMENT. This is because the use of good places changes daily, weekly and seasonally, which makes management critical. Given the certainty of change and fluid nature of the use of a place at different times, the challenge is to develop the ability to respond effectively. 

---

# MANAGEMENT

A good management structure will provide flexibility that allow to responds effectivelly to change.


---

# FUNCTIONNAL FORMS

"Form supports function".
Too often, people think about how they will use a space only after it is built. Keeping in mind active uses when designing or rehabilitating a space can lower costs by discouraging unnecessary and expensive landscaping and monuments, as well as potentially eliminating the need to retrofit a poorly used public space.

---

# SMALL AND BEAUTIFULL ACTIONS

"Start with the petunias". Simple, short­term actions such as planting flowers can be a way of testing ideas and encouraging people their ideas matter. These actions provide flexibility to expand the space by experimenting, evaluating and incorporating results into the next steps and longrange planning.

---

# SMALL BUDGETS

"Money is not the issue".

A lack of money is often used as an excuse for doing nothing. Funds for pure public space improvements often are scarce, so it is important to remember the value of the public space itself to potential partners and search for creative solutions. The location, level of activity, and visibility of
public spaces—combined with a willingness to work closely with local partners—can elicit resources from those involved to activate and enhance these spaces.

# PROMENADES

The words passegiata and paseo translate into English as promenade—and the idea translates too,
according to Christopher Alexander, a former Berkeley Architecture professor who has devoted his life
to scientifically studying what makes places work. In his classic book A Pattern Language, he asks, “Is
the promenade in fact a purely Latin institution? Our experiments suggest that it is not...It seems that people, of all cultures, may have a general need for this kind of human mixing which the promenade
makes possible.”

Alexander lays out the two principles that enhance the experience and sociability of a promenade:
– The route should be approximately 1500 feet, which can easily be walked in 10 minutes at a leisurely
pace. People may opt for many times around—especially teenagers on the lookout for excitement or
romance—but you don’t want to make the course too long for little kids or elderly people.

— It’s important that there are things to see and do along the route, with no empty or dead zones of
more than 150 feet. While the primary purpose of these strolls is social, people also like to have some
destination: a sidewalk café, playground, bookstore, ice cream shop, etc.
Think about what routes in your neighborhood show the most promise for strolling and what
improvements could be made to get people out to meet their neighbors.

Walking up and down Main Street or any lively commercial district is probably the most common
North American version of the promenade, although a route along a waterfront or interesting residential
blocks could work just as well. Public art, welcoming businesses, benches, flowerbeds, even a vending cart could all help solidify this area as the place to see and be seen.

### 11 principles of placemaking
PPS has developed 11 principles that can be used to evolve public spaces into "community places." Although similar words, "spaces" and "places" have very different meanings. A space is a physical description of a piece of land, whereas a "place" connotes an emotional attachment to the piece of land.

1. The community is the expert.
People who use a public space regularly provide the most valuable perspective and insights into how the area functions. They also can help identify issues that are important to consider in improving the space. Uncovering and incorporating their ideas and talents is essential to creating a successful and vital community place.

2. You are creating a place, not a design.
Design is an important component of creating a place, but not the only factor. Providing access and creating active uses, economic opportunities, and programming are often more important than design.

3. You can't do it alone.
A good public space requires partners who contribute innovative ideas, financial or political support, and help plan activities. Partners also can also broaden the impact of a civic space by coordinating schedules for programming and improvement projects.

4. They'll always say, "It can't be done."
Every community has naysayers. When an idea stretches beyond the reach of an organization or its jurisdiction and an official says, "It can't be done," it usually means: "We've never done things that way before." Keep pushing. Identify leaders in the community who share your vision and
build support. Talk to your alderman and get him or her engaged.

5. You can see a lot just by observing.
People will often go to extraordinary lengths to adapt a place to suit their needs. A raised curb can be used as a place to sit, sort mail, and even— believe it or not—cook clams. Observing a space allows you to learn how the space is used.

6. Develop a vision.
A vision for a public space addresses its character, activities, uses, and meaning in the community. This vision should be defined by the people who live or work in or near the space.

7. Form supports function.
Too often, people think about how they will use a space only after it is built. Keeping in mind active uses when designing or rehabilitating a space can lower costs by discouraging unnecessary and expensive landscaping and monuments, as well as potentially eliminating the need to retrofit a poorly used public space.

8. Triangulate.
The concept of triangulation relates to locating elements next to each other in a way that fosters activity. For example, a bench, trash receptacle, and coffee kiosk placed near a bus stop create synergy because they are more convenient for waiting bus passengers and pedestrians than if they

About 80 percent of the success of any public space can be attributed to its management. This is because the use of good places changes daily, weekly and seasonally, which makes management critical. Given the certainty of change and fluid nature of the use of a place at different times,
